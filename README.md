1. **Shots Remover**  
   Hate YouTube Shorts? This extension removes the Shorts section entirely and replaces it with a friendly reminder that you’re not allowed to watch Shorts. It’s simple, effective, and makes sure you’re only seeing the content you want.

2. **Playback Speed Shortcuts**  
   Want to speed up or slow down YouTube videos quickly? This extension lets you adjust the playback speed using easy keyboard shortcuts, and it even shows you the current speed with a nice little pop-up.
